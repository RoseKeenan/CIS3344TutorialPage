            <h2>What is React?</h2>
            <hr>
            <strong> React </strong> is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites. React specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.<br /><br />
            <h3>History</h3>
            React was developed by Facebook in 2011 and given open-source status in 2013 under the controversial BSD3 license. Since its first release, React’s Github repository has generated 96,000 stars from developers and has amassed a community of almost 1200 active contributors, regularly pushing updates to enrich the library. With over 7M downloads in the month of May alone, this library has definitely proven its preference within technology companies.<br /><br />
            <h3>Importance</h3>
            Before React JS, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development. One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can create components, which are like custom, reusable HTML elements, to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces. React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.

            In addition to providing reusable React library code (saving development time and cutting down on the chance for coding errors), React comes with two key features that add to its appeal for JavaScript developers:
            <ul>
                <b>
                    <li>JSX</li>
                    <li>Virtual DOM</li>
                </b>
            </ul>
            <h3>Understanding JSX and Virtual DOM</h3>
            <strong>JSX</strong> is a syntax extension of JavaScript used to create DOM elements which are rendered in the React DOM. Before JSX can render in a web browser it must first be compiled into regular JavaScript. JSX performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript making it faster than normal JavaScript. However using, JSX to update a DOM leads to significant site performance improvements and development efficiency. How? It’s all about the next React feature, the Virtual DOM.<br /><br />

            <strong>The Virtual DOM </strong>is a copy of the site’s DOM, and React JS uses this copy to see what parts of the actual DOM need to change when an event happens. Let’s say a user enters a comment in a blog post form and pushes the “Comment” button. Without using React JS, the entire DOM would have to update to reflect this change (using the time and processing power it takes to make this update). React, on the other hand, scans the Virtual DOM to see what changed after a user action (in this case, a comment being added) and selectively updates that section of the DOM only.<br /><br />

            <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
            <hr />
            React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in Javascript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser’s DOM.

            Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it’s worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speedup its manipulation.

        <h2>React Perequisites</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing around with React. If you've never used JavaScript or the DOM at all before, for example, I would get more familiar with those before trying to tackle React.
            Here are what I consider to be React prerequisites:<br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Basic familiarity with HTML & CSS</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Basic understanding of the DOM</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Set Up and Installation</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            To use React in production, you need NPM and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a>
            <strong>Npm</strong> is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.
            It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.
            It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install,
            and develop node programs<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ReactSetUp">
        <h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            After successfully installing NodeJS, we can start installing React upon it using npm.<br />
            <u>Step 1. Create the Root Folder</u><br /><br>
            Create a folder with name reactApp on the desktop to install all the required files, using the mkdir command:<br />
            <strong class="code">
                C:\Users\username\source\repos>mkdir reactApp<br />
                C:\Users\username\source\repos>cd reactApp
            </strong><br /><br />
            To create any module, it is required to generate the package.json file. Therefore, after Creating the folder, we need to create a package.json file.
            To do so you need to run the npm init command from the command prompt: <br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos\reactApp>npm init -y</strong><br /><br />
            <u>Step 2. Install React and react dom</u><br /><br>
            Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:<br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos>npm install -g create-react-app</strong><br /><br />
            You are now ready to create your first React application! <br /><br />
            Run this command to create a React application named  myFirstReactApp:<br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos>npx create-react-app myFirstReactApp</strong><br /><br />
            <u>Step 3. Run the React Application</u><br /><br>
            Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:<br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos>cd myFirstReactApp</strong><br /><br />
            Run this command to execute the React application myFirstReactApp :<br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos\myFirstReactApp>npm start</strong><br /><br />
            A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.

            The result:<br /><br />
            <img id="ReactBrowser" src="Images/reactBrowser.JPG" alt="Italian Trulli"><br />
            <u>Step 4. Install Bootstrap</u><br /><br>
            Bootstrap is a framework to help you design websites faster and easier. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. We will use Bootstrap to style our react app.<br /><br />
            Run this command to install Bootstrap and import into your index.js file:<br />
            <strong class="code">C:\Users\username\source\repos>npm i Bootstrap</strong><br />
        <p>This line of code should be inserted at the top of your index.js page along with the other imports you will see when you first create your application</p>
        <strong class="code">import Bootstrap\dist\css\bootstrap.css;</strong><br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Step 5. Build the App</u><br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we are ready to build!
        </p>

        <h3>JSX</h3>

        <p>
            First, it’s important to understand JavaScript XML, also known as JSX.
            JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It helps us describe what the User Interface (UI) will look like.
            With JSX, you can create HTML/XML-like structures within your JavaScript file.
            When inserting information into the DOM, we do not need to use methods like appendChild() or createElement().
            JSX converts HTML tags into React elements. You can see more of this in action by clicking <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/showreact.asp?filename=demo2_react_jsx1">
                this example
            </a>.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Our Files
        </h3>

        <p>
            Now that we have some basic knowledge of JSX, let’s start building our application. You have seen what the default React Application looks like.
            So, let’s look at our setup and see how this is being displayed.
            <br />
            <img class="center-image" src="Images/folders.PNG" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Under our public folder, we have our logos, favicon, index, and some other files but we don’t have to worry about them for this tutorial.
            Looking under our src folder, we see our CSS and JavaScript files. The files named App contains the information that displays our default app.
            We don’t need to worry about those since we’re going to create our own application.
        </p>

        <p>
            The files named Index are the CSS and Javascript files for our index page. We will work with the CSS file solely for styling.
            We want to mention that because we are using the Boostrap library, sometimes you might notice that your styles won’t be showing up.
            This is because Bootstrap styles are being applied that override your created styles. You will see this later when creating Bootstrap
            styled buttons but, if you wanted to change the color of a Bootstrap button or any other attribute in a Bootstrap class, then you must put
            <strong class="code">!important </strong>next to your style. This CSS property means that all previous CSS of that element with that property should be
            ignored and the important property should be applied.

        </p>

        <h3>Creating Components</h3>

        <p>
            Moving forward, let’s create a subfolder under the src folder. We will name this “components”. This is where we will organize our JSX files.
            <br />
            <img class="center-image" src="Images/components-folder.PNG" />
        </p>

        <h3>Welcome Component</h3>

        <p>
            Now, let’s create a Welcome page. This is how we styled our welcome page. Feel free to style it however you want by manipulating your index.css file.
            <br />
            <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/welcome.PNG" />
        </p>

        <p>
            First, we will create a JSX file called “welcome.jsx”. When you create this file, it will be empty. The first thing you want to add are your imports.
            For now, we will just import React, and a component.
            <br />
            <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/welcome-import.PNG" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we want to create our class. We name this class Welcome and it extends Component. Within this component, you MUST have a method called render().
            This tells what to show or do when the component renders/loads.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our render() method, we are going to insert information that we would like the user to see when the page loads.
            This will be put into a return method. For now, let’s just put in a header that says welcome and two bootstrap styled buttons.
            Note that when we are adding classes such as classes we have made or Bootstrap classes, we use the keyword className instead of the keyword class
            that you would typically use when editing HTML. This is because we are creating JSX components, not vanilla HTML.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/code1.PNG" />

        <p>
            At the end of our welcome.jsx file, we must export our class. This will allow us to use it in other files when we import each component.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we must go to our index.js file to edit what file it will load first. In the code for the <strong class="code">ReactDOM.render() </strong> method, you will see
            that it is loading <strong class="code"> &lt;App/&gt; </strong>	. This means that it is loading the App component found in App.js file. We want to change this to our new component,
            Welcome. So, replace <strong class="code">&lt;App/&gt;</strong> with <strong class="code">&lt;Welcome/&gt;</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, we have to import our component into our index.js file. So you must have the following import statement.
            Your index.js file should look like this:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/code2 - Copy.PNG" />

        <p>
            Now, we are ready to see what our app looks like. Don’t worry if it is ugly right now! We haven’t added any styles yet!
            Let’s open up our terminal, go into our change our directory so that we are in the folder with our application, and type <strong class="code">npm start</strong>.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/first-welcome.PNG" />

        <p>
            The buttons of our applcation look nice and styled because we used Bootstrap classes. You can find find our more about Bootstrap
            and its classes in the Bootstrap documentation linked here: <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/"> Bootstrap Documentation </a> OR
            you can use a list of all the classes that w3schools has provided here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp">w3schools Boostrap Classes List</a>
            Let's add some styling to our css. This can be totally up to you and you can use your basic HTML/CSS knowledge to do this! If you would like to see our css,
            we'll link you to our <a href="https://github.com/RoseKeenan/Quizzical/blob/master/quizzical-react-app/src/index.css"> github for this project.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Catgeory Component</h3>

        <p>
            Let’s work on our create a quiz button first. We want this button to load another component that will ask the user to enter a category.
            So, let’s create another JSX file within our components folder. Let’s name this one “category.jsx”.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let’s get our imports. We’re going to import  React, component, and FadeIn. Fade in will just make things transition a little nicer.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/fade-in-import.PNG" />

        <p>
            Let’s first create our class headers just like the last time. We are going to type up some HTML for input radio buttons.
            This should be an easier task. Remember, that this code goes into our <strong class="code"> render() </strong>method
            and within the <strong class='code'>render()</strong>
            method, you should have a <strong class="code">return()</strong> that holds this code. We can add the <strong class="code"> &lt;FadeIn&gt;</strong> at
            the beginning of code return to have a nice transition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we need to add a submit button at the end. You can add as many or as little categories as you want - this is your quiz app afterall :)
            For now, let's just have it do nothing. Remember to export your class at the end of your file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's backtrack a little bit. We want to reach this page after the user hits create quiz on the welcome page. How will we do that? Well, let's
            go back to our welcome.jsx file. In our class, let's add a state. This defines some properties for the class. To get used to this idea, add
            a property called "message" and set it equal to a string that says a welcome message. We can also add a "renderView" property and set it equal
            to 0 - we will use this later.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/welcome-message.PNG" />

        <p>
            Now, instead of having the h1 of our component have the string, we can use the class' message property instead. This should do the same job
            as hard coding it within the HTML of the JSX component.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/h1.PNG" />

        <p>
            We now have to do some thinking on how we can get the category component to load when the user hits on the button. We can do this by using
            event handlers and our renderView property. When the user hits on the create quiz button, we can set the state of the renderView property to
            1. Then, we can have a simple if statement that says, if the renderView = 1, load the new component. Let us show you how we did this.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/constructor-welcome.PNG" />

        <p>
            We need this constructor so that the state and methods are binded to the class and we can use the "this" keyword throughout the class.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/render-welcome.PNG" />

        <p>The last thing we need to do is import the category component at the top.</p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/category-import.PNG" />

        <p>
            Now, if you did not type anything else in the terminal, your program should still be running. If not, you can type <strong class="code">npm start</strong>
            again. Let's see if this works! First, it should open our nicely styled Welcome page...
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/styled-welcome.PNG" />

        <p>
            And then when we click the create quiz button, it should load the category component.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/create-a-quiz.PNG" />

        <p>
            We can use this same logic for our take a quiz button. We just make that so that when the user hits that button, the renderView will be changed to 2
            and another component will be loaded. This component will be made next.
        </p>

        <h3>Take Quiz Component</h3>

        <p>
            Let's create our take a quiz component. This will be a page where the user can take some premade quizzes. First, let's create our quizzes. This will be a
            separate component. We will have one quiz for each category. Our app has 4 categories so we're going to have to create 4 quizzes. This is a pretty simple
            task. First, create a jsx component called "quizInfo.jsx". This will store all of our quiz information for every category. Each quiz will simply be an
            array of objects with an id, question, answers, and a correct answer. We want these arrays to be constant and we
            will export each one instead of just one at the bottom of our file like we have usually been doing. Refer to the image below and create your quizzes.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/food-quiz.PNG" />

        <p>
            If you are confident that you can do this, feel free to use <a herf="https://github.com/RoseKeenan/Quizzical/blob/master/quizzical-react-app/src/components/quizInfo.jsx">our code found on our github</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we have our quiz information created, we have to do something with this information. To create and display each quiz, we have to create a new
            component for each quiz. We will walk you through one quiz. For the other quizzes, just repeat the steps and change the information to match that particular
            quiz.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll be walking through the food quiz. First, you'll want to create your jsx component, import react, component, and the foodQuiz const from the quizInfo object.
            Like so:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/importquizinfo.PNG" />

        <p>
            Food Quiz, create a state object that has six properties.
            Set currentQuestion to zero, myAnswer to null, options is an empty array, score is zero, disabled equal to true and isEnd false.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/foodquiz.PNG" />

        <p>
            Then create a method called loadQuizData that sets the current state of foodQuiz. Set the properties: questions,
            answer and options equal to the foodQuiz array properties in QuizInfo.jsx.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/loadquiz.PNG" />

        <p>
            Then create the react the componentDidMount method, which gets invoked after the foodQuiz component is added to the DOM tree.
            This method will call the loadQuizData to load the data that will be used later on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let’s create a next question method, We set the current state object to a const with properties
            named myAnswer, answer and score. Then we compare the currentQuestion's answer to the answer the user selected.
            If they are a match then we increment the score by 100. Lastly, we move on to the next question by adding 1 to the currentQuestion property.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/didmount.PNG" />

        <p>
            Next we create a method, called componentDidUpdate, which gets called after componentDidMount.
            Inside the method we check to see if the currentQuestion and the previous question are different.
            If they are then we change the state of the object.
        </p>

        <p>
            Create a method named checkAnswer to which sets the option the user clicked on equal to myAnswer property then
            disabled becomes false which allows the user to click on the next button.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finish method checks to see if the user has completed the quiz if they had then isEnd equals true.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image"src="Images/componentdidupdate.PNG" />

        <p>
            In the react render method, display the welcome message along with the quiz title.
            Then show the first question of the quiz and the remaining number of questions in total.
            Then create a new array with a unique key for each multiple choice by using the map function.
            Attach an event handler to whichever option the user picks and call the checkAnswer method. Once the user selects
            an option they will be able to click on the next button. Which will call the nextQuestion method.
            Once the user has completed the quiz isEnd will become true and the list of answers and the user’s score will display.

        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/render-quiz.PNG" />

        <h3>Create Quiz Component</h3>

        <p>
            Now that we have the premade quizzes finished and working, let’s go back to creating a quiz. Let’s recall where we left off.
            First the user clicks on the Create Quiz button, then the category component loads where the user will put an input (whether that
            be radio buttons, text box, dropdown). Now that the user has chosen a category, we have to move on to the creation of the quiz.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will make a new jsx component called createQuestion.jsx. This component will allow the user to create questions for their quiz.
            They are also given the opportunity to name their quiz. First, let’s get our imports. We’re going to again import react and component from react.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let’s create our CreateQuestions class. Let’s first get the HTML out of the way. The user will be able to create 3 questions for their quiz.
            Yes, this is a small quiz but it is easily expandable. First, create a header this component. Then, create a textbox for the user to enter the
            name of their quiz.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, create text boxes for the following:
            <ul>
                <li>The question</li>
                <li>The CORRECT answer</li>
                <li>Three WRONG answers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is what we want each question input to look like:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/question-template.PNG" />

        <p>
            This can be done using what you know from HTML and CSS. Again, you can check out our github to look at how we styled our inputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let’s move on to the class’ constructor. The constructor will create all the variables we need to store the inputs of the user.
            It will also bind the submit event handler, allow us to pass different properties, and allow us to use “this”.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our state within the constructor, let’s create the variables that will store the inputs from the user. We will end up with something like this:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/constructor-create.PNG" />

        <p>
            We need an event handler for our submit button. This will be like all our other submit event handlers using renderView.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/onsubmit.PNG" />

        <p>
            Now, we need to create an array of questions and answers that will be passed later. We will pass them when the user hits submit
            or in other words, when the viewRender is equal to 1. These will be stored as objects.
            So, we must take the values of the variables that store the inputs. We just made these variables in our constructor’s state.
            By using this, we can grab those values and create our array. It will look something like this:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/statequestions.PNG" />

        <p>
            Repeat this for all your questions. At the end of this if statement, you will return another component and pass in the array.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we need a way to handle when the inputs are entered into the text boxes.
            In other words, we need a way to put the values of the text boxes and store them in to the values we made in the constructor.
            To do this, we created an handleChange method.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/handleChange.PNG" />

        <p>
            This sets the corresponding state value to the value of the text box. But, we need to add a few things to our inputs now to link the targets.
            In our inputs, we need to have a value property. This will be set equal to the corresponding state value. We also need to describe what
            happens when the input value is changed. For this, we use the onChange property and call the handleChange method.
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/value.PNG" />

        <p>
            That was a lot we covered, so please feel free to check our github file for this component found <a href="https://github.com/RoseKeenan/Quizzical/blob/master/quizzical-react-app/src/components/createQuestion.jsx">here</a>. Don't forget to export this class at the end.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let's create our last component. This component will allow the user to take their quiz. Let's call this component UserQuiz.jsx.
            UserQuiz.jsx will look very similar to all the other quizzes we have made. It contains all the same methods as the other quizzes. The only difference
            is that we will shuffle the options. This is done very simply. Copy the code from one of the premade quizzes and change the details accordingly.
            Basically, you'll be changing the export and the class name.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, create your shuffle method. Shuffles methods can easily be found online. Here is the one we used:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/shuffle.PNG" />

        <p>
            Now we just have to make a few simple changes within our methods and then we'll be done! Whenever you get the options to the questions, you want to call this method.
            You will be doing this in two places, the <strong class="code">loadQuizData()</strong>  method, and the <strong class="code">componentDidUpdate() </strong>method.
            They should both look like this:
        </p>

        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/load.PNG" />
        <img class="bigger-image" src="Images/update.PNG" />

        <p>
            This will effectively shuffle the answers and return the array. :)
        </p>

        <h3>That's it!</h3>

            React is a great JavaScript library to use. Not only is there extensive documentation, but it is extremely popular. Many companies are interested in programmers who
            know this framework. React helps you easily create beautiful, interactive UI. With an understanding of React, programmers will be able to apply this
            to many other JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project helps beginner programmers understand the basics of React. Not only does it give an overview of components, but it walks through how to create them
            and pass data between them. It also gives them an opportunity to explore Bootstrap. With Bootstrap, you can easily create very eye appealing elements by assigning
            premade classes.
